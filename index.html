1Above all, think first WHAT you want to GET, 
separating it of HOW you will get it. 
Ideally, you should use a formal lenguaje (as UML), 
but any kind of mock is welcome to express the 
funcionality expected.



2Once you get a clear idea about WHAT to do, 
spend some time giving some thoughts about HOW to do it. At least, you will always find two or more ways to do the same task, and one of them, will be better than the others (more efficient, logical or reusable)




3Don’t forget to make always comments in your code. 
It will be helpfull; even for yourself



4Use representative identifiers, naming variables, 
classes and functions properly. Don’t mind if an 
identifier becomes a bit long.


5Test your code every few lines. For sure, eventually, 
you will have to do formal unit and integrated tests, 
but, try to get used to testing every bit. 
Otherwise, you could lose too much time after.


6If a function takes up more than a screen, 
try to divide it. It will be always better and easier 
to maintain.


7Keep a “Main” always available: If you are not 
sure about how a function or a library works, keep 
it simple: give it a try.


8Ctrl + S: Please, make always a backup of your work day. 
Using an external repository, is a must.


9If you could define a data as constant, 
or property, do it. 
The more constants you use, the better code 
you will get.


10If you become very confused with some algorithm, 
stop thinking about it. Take a breath! 
Although you aren’t aware of it, your mind will 
continue working in the background and will resolve 
it magically. Eureka! ;)


EXTRA (+1) Last but not least “Divide and conquer”. 
Try always to subdivide each process into smaller ones. 
For each one of these subprocesses, identify clearly 
INPUT, OUTPUT and FUNCTION, before start coding.
